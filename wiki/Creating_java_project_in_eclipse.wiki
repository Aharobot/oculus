*Creating new eclipse project from svn:*
  # download oculus win32 archive, unpack
  # make backup copies of Oculus/webapps/oculus/flash & images folders and their contents, you'll need to recopy them back later
  # delete Oculus/webapps/oculus folder and contents
  # open eclipse with subclipse plugin
  # set working directory to Oculus/webapps
  # set svn repository to https://oculus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ 
    * select the 'oculus' branch ('flex' can be imported into xxxbuilder)
  # checkout /trunk/oculus as new project 'oculus'
  # under project properties > java build path:
    * remove src folder created by default
    * add WEB-INF/src as src folder
    * change default output folder to oculus/WEB-INF/classes
    * add Jars > select all under /oculus/WEB-INF/lib > add
    * add External Jars:  red5.jar (*NOTE* you have link to a COPY of red5.jar, so no conflits with red5 core operation)
  # Change project setup, add JUnit4 library to build path
  # copy flash and images folders and their contents (from backup created in step 2) to Oculus/
  # make sure Oculus/webapps/.metadata folder is hidden or red5 will try to run it
